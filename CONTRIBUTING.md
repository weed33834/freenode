# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve FreeNode.

## How to contribute

1. **Fork** the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes.
3. Run `make test` and `make lint` to verify nothing is broken.
4. If you added a new source, add its entry to `config/sources.json`.
5. If you added a new protocol parser, add corresponding unit tests under
   `tests/`.
6. **Never commit secrets.** Run `scripts/check_secrets.sh` before pushing.
7. Open a Pull Request with a clear description of what you changed and why.

## Code style

- Python 3.13+, type hints required on all public functions.
- Use `ruff` for formatting and linting (`make lint`).
- Comments explain *why*, not *what* (the code should be self-documenting).
- Keep imports minimal and standard-library-first.

## Testing

- `make test` runs the full test suite.
- If you modify the pipeline, try a live run:
  `python scripts/update.py --no-verify`
- If you modify the verifier, also test with `--verify`.
