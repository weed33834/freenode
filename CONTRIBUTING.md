## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Create a feature branch from `main` (see [Branch Naming](#branch-naming)).
4. Make your changes following the standards below.
5. Push and open a Pull Request.

## Development Workflow

**All changes — without exception — must go through a Pull Request.**

No direct commits to `main` are allowed. This applies to the maintainer, contributors, and automated bots alike.

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with the following prefixes:

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Feature | `feat/<short-description>` | `feat/add-export-function` |
| Bug fix | `fix/<short-description>` | `fix/login-redirect-loop` |
| Docs | `docs/<short-description>` | `docs/update-api-reference` |
| Refactor | `refactor/<short-description>` | `refactor/simplify-auth-module` |
| Chore | `chore/<short-description>` | `chore/upgrade-dependencies` |

### Development Checklist

Before opening a PR, verify each item below. See `docs/DEVELOPER_CHECKLIST.md` for the full checklist.

- [ ] Code follows the project's style guide (linting passes)
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests added for new functionality
- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or credentials committed
- [ ] No debug code, console logs, or commented-out blocks
- [ ] No AI-generated boilerplate without human review
- [ ] Commit messages follow the convention below
- [ ] Branch is up to date with `main`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Open an issue first** for any non-trivial change to discuss the approach.
2. Create a branch following the naming convention.
3. Make atomic, focused commits — one logical change per commit.
4. Keep PRs small and reviewable (ideally under 400 lines of diff).
5. Fill out the PR template completely.
6. Ensure all CI checks pass before requesting review.
7. A maintainer must approve and merge the PR.

### PR Size Guidelines

| Size | Lines Changed | Action |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Ideal | < 200 | Proceed |
| Acceptable | 200–400 | Consider splitting |
| Too large | > 400 | Must split into smaller PRs |

## Commit Conventions

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>
```

### Types

- `feat` — New feature
- `fix` — Bug fix
- `docs` — Documentation only
- `refactor` — Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` — Performance improvement
- `test` — Adding or correcting tests
- `chore` — Build, CI, dependencies, tooling
- `ci` — CI/CD changes

### Rules

- Subject line: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, max 72 characters
- Body: explain *what* and *why*, not *how* — wrap at 72 characters
- One logical change per commit — no mixed concerns
- No AI-style bulk messages (e.g., "comprehensive audit fix", "P0/P1/P2 batch fix")
- No emoji in commit messages
- Reference issues: `Closes #123`, `Refs #456`

### Examples

```
feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation

Implements rotating refresh tokens with a 7-day sliding window.
Blacklists compromised tokens via Redis for immediate revocation.

Closes #42
```

```
fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint

The /users/:id endpoint returned 500 when the database row was
null. Adds explicit null check and returns 404 instead.
```

## Code Standards

- Run the linter before committing (`make lint` or equivalent)
- Format code with the project's configured formatter
- Remove trailing whitespace and unused imports
- No `any` types in TypeScript without justification
- No `console.log` in production code — use a logger
- Functions should do one thing and be testable in isolation

## Issue Guidelines

### Before Opening an Issue

- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Use the appropriate issue template (bug report or feature request)
- Provide a minimal reproduction case for bugs
- Include environment details (OS, runtime version, etc.)

### Issue Lifecycle

1. **Open** — Issue is created with a template
2. **Triaged** — Maintainer labels and assigns priority
3. **In Progress** — Someone is working on it
4. **Closed** — Fixed, duplicated, or wontfix

## Mirror Notice

This repository is primarily hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/MS33834).
A read-only mirror is available on [GitCode](https://gitcode.com/badhope) for
users in regions where GitHub access is restricted.

**GitHub is the canonical source.** All issues, pull requests, and discussions
should be directed to the GitHub repository. The GitCode mirror receives updates
manually and may lag behind.

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue with the `question` label if anything is unclear.
